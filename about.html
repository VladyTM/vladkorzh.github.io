      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>This page gives a more personal look into who I am, where I come from, and where Iâ€™m going.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>I was born in Moscow, Russia and lived there for 4 years before moving to South Africa where I have remained since. Over time I developed a passion for exploring, innovating and designing. I have carried this interest and passion into my adulthood, and plan to make it the primary goal of my future career path.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>What I'm Passionate About</h2>
      <p>I love problem solving, data, and innovating unique ideas for everyday problems. Programming has always come hand in hand with these interests for me, and I find myself constantly creating tools, apps, and software to do various tasks in my everyday life. </p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Beyond the Work</h2>
      <p>I enjoy traveling, nature, and all the "little" things in life. I have a passion for photography wherever I go, and social work has a special place in my heart as an activity I enjoy participating in. I have played many sports, and even then piano, and I certainly still enjoy the physical aspects of sports.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>I forsee my aspirations taking me to the UK, where I wish to study Finance, Business and Managment. I hope my innovative skills and passion for design and creation will lead me to become the CEO of a startup or an innovation based firm which will allow me to dip my feet in whatever sector interest me.</p>
